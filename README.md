# PII (Personal Identifiable Information) and secret check hooks for pre-commit

## Installation
Install pre-commit - [Install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

Make sure you run:

    pre-commit install
    pre-commit autoupdate

## Setting up
 * Add `.pii-secret-hook` to your .gitignore
 * Copy `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to your repo, or if using pre-commit already, add the hooks from this project to your existing file
 * Add a `pii-secret-exclude.txt` file if needed (explanation below)
 * Add a `pii-custom-regex.txt` file if needed (explanation below)
 * Add a `pii-ner-exclude.txt` file if needed (explanation below)

## Tracking exclusions
A file is written to, which should be included in committed files, which records a hash of
files checked by the hooks.
 
## Excluding files with `pii-secret-exclude.txt` file.
In order to exclude files from the checks, add them to this file. HOWEVER, you should 
heavily favour excluding lines using `/PS-IGNORE`, rather than files.

## Adding your own regular expressions with `pii-custom-regex.txt` file.
Add our own regexes for secret or PII identification. Each one should be added one per line in the format:

    name=regex

Regexes used should be Python compatible and should not use start and end markers.

## Excluding false positives from the file content hook with `pii-ignore-strings.txt` file.
Add your own list of strings to ignore from the file content check in the `pii-ignore-strings.txt` file.

Example pii-ignore-strings.txt:
```
F680
f680
```

## Excluding false positives from the NER hook with `pii-ner-exclude.txt` file.
Add your own list of entities that should be excluded in the
`pii-ner-exclude.txt` file.

## Generating an exclude file with a list of NER entities to exclude
If you want to output NER entities into a single file (very useful when setting up a repo), you can 
add the --exclude_output_file to your pre-commit configuration as follows:

    id: pii_secret_file_content_ner
    args: [--exclude_output_file=exclude_file_path]
    ...

where `exclude_file_path` is the path to the exclude file you want to output to.

## Initial run
Run the following command to identify issues in your repo.

    pre-commit run --all-files

If PII or a secret is found is a false positive, add `/PS-IGNORE` (put this in a 
comment if needed) to any affected lines or, if you are certain a file can be 
excluded and will not change in the future, add it to the `pii-secret-exclude.txt` file.

## When committing
This logic should be run on every commit. When you find a false positive. Add 
`/PS-IGNORE` to the affected line or exclude the file (see caveats above).

Please report issues and bugs to the Live Services Team.

## Updating the hooks
In order to run the latest version of these hooks run:

    pre-commit autoupdate

## If the hooks pass but the commit fails
Try running:

    pre-commit gc; pre-commit clean

## TODO
 * Check for duplication before adding to NER exclude file
 * Log file is overwritten and loses content when application is executed
 * Add office (and any other relevant) extensions
 * Add help command
